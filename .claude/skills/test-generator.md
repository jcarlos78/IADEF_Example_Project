name: test-generator
description: Generates automated tests from an existing SDD spec. Maps each acceptance criterion to one or more test cases. Use after a spec is approved and before implementing the code it describes.
---

# Skill: test-generator

## When to activate
- An approved spec exists at `specs/<feature>/spec.md`
- Implementation hasn't started (or is just starting)
- The user explicitly asks for tests generated from a spec

## Why run this before implementation
The skill is designed for **tests-first**: tests derived from the spec represent the external contract the implementation must honor. Implementing first blurs the criterion.

## Playbook

### 1. Load the spec
Read `specs/<feature>/spec.md`, especially:
- The "Use cases" section
- The "Acceptance criteria" section
- The "Out of scope" section (to generate negative tests where applicable)

### 2. Load the test stack
Check `.claude/CLAUDE.md` or `package.json` / `pyproject.toml` to identify the test framework in use. Do not introduce a new framework.

### 3. Map criterion → test

For each acceptance criterion, generate one or more tests:
- **Happy path test** (the scenario described in the main use case)
- **Alternative path test** (variations mentioned in the spec)
- **Error test** (violated preconditions, invalid inputs)
- **Edge case test** (numeric limits, empty strings, empty lists)

### 4. Test file structure

```
# Suggested layout (adapt to the framework):

describe/feature("<Feature name>")
  describe/context("Criterion 1: <criterion text>")
    test/it("given X when Y then Z")
    test/it("edge: ...")
  describe/context("Criterion 2: ...")
    ...
```

### 5. Confirm coverage

Before finishing, produce a traceability table:

| Acceptance criterion | Generated test(s) |
|---|---|
| Criterion 1 | `test_criterion_1_happy`, `test_criterion_1_edge` |
| Criterion 2 | `test_criterion_2_happy`, `test_criterion_2_error` |

If a criterion has no matching test → report the gap to the user.

## Principles

- **Each test proves one criterion.** Don't bundle multiple criteria in one test.
- **Readable names.** Test names become executable documentation.
- **No production code.** This skill produces tests that will *fail* until the implementation happens (red-green-refactor).
- **No excessive mocks.** Mock only what is outside the scope of the test; code under test should actually run.

## Expected output
One or more test files in the project's conventional location (`tests/`, `__tests__/`, etc.) + a traceability report.

Expected status of the tests at the end: **red** (failing) — because the implementation doesn't exist yet. That's the point.
