# IADE Project Template

> **This repo is being used to build a Planning Poker web app** — see [specs/planning-poker/](specs/planning-poker/) for the SDD docs (spec, plan, tasks) and [docs/adr/](docs/adr/) for architectural decisions.
>
> **Quick start (this app):**
>
> ```bash
> npm install
> npm run dev          # http://localhost:3000
> npm run typecheck    # tsc --noEmit
> npm run build
> ```

A pre-configured **Integrated Agentive Development Environment (IADE)** for disciplined vibe coding with AI assistants (Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf, Codex, etc.).

Use this as the base for any new project where you want AI-assisted development with proper guardrails: spec-first, test-first, human-in-command.

## What you get out of the box

Three native amplifiers wired up and ready:

- **Skills** in `.claude/skills/` — reusable agent procedures (spec writing, code review, ADRs, test generation)
- **MCPs** in `.mcp.json` — Model Context Protocol server config (filesystem, postgres, GitHub, custom APIs)
- **SDD** in `specs/` — Spec-Driven Development structure with a working example

## Getting started

### 1. Use this template

On GitHub, click **"Use this template"**. Or clone manually:

```bash
git clone <this-repo-url> my-project
cd my-project
rm -rf .git && git init
```

### 2. Customize

- Edit `.claude/CLAUDE.md` with your project briefing
- Adapt `specs/constitution.md` to your team's principles
- Edit `.mcp.json` to point at the systems you actually use (or remove servers you don't)
- Keep or drop skills as needed

### 3. Open in your agentive IDE

- **Claude Code**: run `claude` in the project root
- **Cursor / Windsurf**: open the folder; both honor `.claude/`
- **Codex**: point the CLI at the directory

### 4. Start with the SDD flow

**Don't ask for code before writing a spec.** Use the `spec-writer` skill:

```
/spec-writer I want to add: users can export their history as CSV
```

The skill walks you through: **spec → plan → tasks → implementation**, with a human gate at each step.

## Philosophy

Vibe coding works best with guardrails. This template enforces a few non-negotiables (see `specs/constitution.md`):

1. **Spec before code** — describe observable behavior before generating implementation
2. **Tests track behavior** — every behavioral change needs tests
3. **Human approval before commit** — Human-In-Command (HIC) mode by default
4. **Comments explain *why*, not *what*** — naming documents the what
5. **Architectural decisions become ADRs** — immutable, traceable
6. **Secrets never enter the repo** — even in example files
7. **Atomic changes** — one concern per commit/PR
8. **Fail loudly, not silently** — no swallowed errors

You can relax any of these as your team matures — but only via an explicit ADR.

## Suggested first steps after cloning

1. Read `specs/constitution.md` together as a team and edit it to match your beliefs.
2. Use `specs/example-feature/` as a reference for your first real spec.
3. Try one full loop: `spec-writer` → review → `test-generator` → implement → `code-reviewer`.
4. Document your first real architectural decision with the `adr-writer` skill.
